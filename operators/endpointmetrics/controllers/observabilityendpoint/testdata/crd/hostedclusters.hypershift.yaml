            HostedCluster is the primary representation of a HyperShift cluster and encapsulates
            the control plane and common data plane configuration. Creating a HostedCluster
            results in a fully functional OpenShift control plane with no attached nodes.
            To support workloads (e.g. pods), a HostedCluster may have one or more associated
            NodePool resources.

                            For the KubeVirt platform, the basedomain can be autogenerated using
                            the *.apps domain of the management/infra hosting cluster

                            requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                            matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                            Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                            annotation, and affect route admission.


                            A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                            "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                            E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains


                            - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                            then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                            is rejected.
                            - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                            determines the route's admission status.
                            - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                            then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.


                            The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                            admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                            However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.


                            Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                                          Set to "NoPrefix" to disable prefixing.


                                          Example:

                            defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                            restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                            created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                            nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                            For example,
                            defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                            field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                            in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                            impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                            the namespace.
                            For example, if a new namespace is created with
                            node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                            the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                            gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                            is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                            for defaultNodeSelector field.
                            For instance,
                            openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                            that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                            would not be applied.

                                Dynamic resource allocation is an API for requesting and sharing resources between pods and containers inside a pod.
                                Third-party resource drivers are responsible for tracking and allocating resources.
                                Different kinds of resources support arbitrary parameters for defining requirements and initialization.
                                Valid values are Enabled, Disabled and omitted.
                                When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default,
                                which is subject to change over time.
                                The current default is Disabled.

                        registries, and policies to block or allow registry hostnames.
                        When exposing OpenShift's image registry to the public, this also lets cluster
                        admins specify the external hostname.

                                type defines what encryption type should be used to encrypt resources at the datastore layer.
                                When this field is unset (i.e. when it is set to the empty string), identity is implied.
                                The behavior of unset can and will change over time.  Even if encryption is enabled by default,
                                the meaning of unset may change to a different encryption type based on changes in best practices.


                                When encryption is enabled, all sensitive resources shipped with the platform are encrypted.

                                Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on:


                                https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations


                                The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers
                                are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be
                                reduced.


                                Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not
                                yet well adopted by common software libraries.

                            This is useful to choose a port other than the default one which might interfere with customer environments e.g. https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/356.

                            Doing so, it would result in the controller overriding the KAS endpoint in the guest cluster having a discrepancy with the KAS Pod and potentially causing temporarily network failures.

                                LoadBalancer. In general, this is only useful for bare-metal clusters.
                                In Openshift 3.x, this was misleadingly called "IngressIPs".
                                Automatically assigned External IPs are not affected by any
                                ExternalIPPolicy rules.
                                Currently, only one entry may be provided.

                          description: |-
                            requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                            matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                            Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                            annotation, and affect route admission.


                            A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                            "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                            E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains


                            - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                            then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                            is rejected.
                            - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                            determines the route's admission status.
                            - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                            then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.


                            The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                            admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                            However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.


                            Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                                used within this temporal window. The user will need to acquire a new
                                token to regain access once a token times out. Takes valid time

                            nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                            For example,
                            defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                            field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                            in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                            impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                            the namespace.
                            For example, if a new namespace is created with

                            the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east

                                The following profiles are provided:
                                - Default: default policy which means MetaData level logging with the exception of events

                                are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues.
                                If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging
                                and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.
